## 💻 Java Projects

- **[MasterMind & Wordle Game Project](https://github.com/carpoeric/MindGames)**
  >  I created this project to help people improve their cognitive skills. I believe that games are a great way to exercise your brain and have fun at the same time. Additionally, I wanted to implement things in this project that would help me improve and showcase my coding skills. I learned a lot about Java and object-oriented programming while working on this project.

## 🗃️ LinkedIn Internship
